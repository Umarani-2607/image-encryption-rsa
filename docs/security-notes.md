# Security Notes

This project demonstrates RSA-based encryption for educational purposes.

---

## Key Security Considerations

- RSA is not suitable for encrypting large files directly
- Real systems use hybrid encryption (RSA + AES)
- This project intentionally encrypts limited data to demonstrate constraints

---

## Key Management

- RSA keys are generated locally
- Private keys are excluded from version control
- This follows standard security best practices

---

## Educational Scope

This project is designed to explain cryptographic principles,
not to serve as a production encryption system.
